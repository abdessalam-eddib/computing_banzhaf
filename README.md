# Computing Banzhaf Indexes
- We present two approaches to compute banzhaf indexes for tree based algorithms, the first one relies on brute-force, as for the second on eit relies on the tree structure to facilitate the computations and improve its complexity.
- For further details, you can check the report we wrote explaining the two approaches.
